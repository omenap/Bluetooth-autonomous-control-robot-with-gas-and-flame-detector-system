# Bluetooth-autonomous-control-robot-with-gas-and-flame-detector-system
This is a beautiful system i developed for a Gas refining company, and this system is an autonomous and bluetooth control robot car, that houses a gas and flame sensor.
The device simply goes around either on autonomous mode or being controlled through a bluetooth control pad, detecting gas and fire. Whenever there is a gas or fire detected, it triggers an alarm to notify people around that there's gas detected in that area.
This device would help discover gas lekages and also help help notify users once fire is detected.
